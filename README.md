# odin-recipes

This is a website will include headings, images, and links for recipes.
By the end of building this webpage, I will have correctly used the 
previously stated HTML elements as well as checked that it works. This
includes creating the HTML boiler plate from memory as well as getting 
used to using Ubuntu, command line, and VSCode.
